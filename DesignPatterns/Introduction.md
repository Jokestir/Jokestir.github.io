### What is a design pattern?

Design patterns are `best practise strategies` to solve a `recurring problem`.


Whenever a problem arises, there are two options.

Questions to be asked when studying a design pattern

1. What is the common recurring problem?

2. What are the best strategies to solve them? (aka design)

3. Sample code

4. Real time use

### Types of design patterns

There are 3 types of design patterns (CSB)

#### 1. Creational design patterns


Creational design patterns focus on controlling the object creation process

e.g: Constructor, Factory, Prototype, Singleton, Builder

#### 2. Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns focus on realizing relationships between different objects.

e.g: Decorator, facade, Flyweight, Adapter, Proxy

#### 3. Behavioral design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns focus on improving or streamlining communication between objects

e.g: Iterator, Mediator, Observer and mediator.
