			- Apply for professional courses. Only STEM
            - leverage strengths. do IT
			- Highlight work ex to make up for non computer background. Also college and office projects
			- REsume : Roles and responsibilities

			- CMU : some networking courses. Highlight your job.
            - visa problem for jobs. so tough luck
